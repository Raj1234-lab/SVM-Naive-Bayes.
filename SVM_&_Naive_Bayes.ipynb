        "Pre-pruning, or early stopping, is a technique in decision trees that halts the growth of a tree before it becomes fully developed to prevent overfitting. It stops the tree-building process based on certain criteria, such as reaching a maximum depth, having too few samples in a node, or not achieving a minimum impurity decrease from a split. This approach restricts the complexity of the model from the beginning, leading to a smaller, simpler tree that may generalize better to new data.\n",
